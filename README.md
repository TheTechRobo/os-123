Easy-to-use OSes that I really like


All these OSes are unpopular, so I am giving them a few more users. These OSes are also awesome.

Please support Elive! The developer is not paying me to say this but Elive's future is in doubt. Elive is first in LIST-OF-OSES.md

The developer needs 600 patrons on Patreon to hire another developer! Chip in and you will NOT be sorry. If another developer comes, then the next version will take half the time! The next version will have Debian Buster, 64bit support, and more!
